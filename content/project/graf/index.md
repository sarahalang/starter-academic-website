The [Graz Repository of Ancient Fables](https://gams.uni-graz.at/graf) is a learner-oriented digital edition of ancient fables (Latin and Ancient Greek). 

I contributed to this project as the Digital Humanities partner and have been responsible for both the design of the website and the modelling of the data. 
The data are given in TEI-XML and are long-term archived in the Fedora-based GAMS respository infrastructure.
The web and print representations in HTML and LaTeX are generated from the TEI sources following the single source principe, using XSLT data transformations.

The portal offers both scholarly introductions to subjects relevant to the ancient fable as well as primary sources which were prepared for teaching scenarios by contributing schools (Citizen Science). 
It also offers a bibliography, a list of intertexts and a list of references to online materials for Classics teaching.
