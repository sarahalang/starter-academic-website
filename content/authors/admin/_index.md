I have a Dr. phil. in Digital Humanities and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Department “Centre for Information Modelling” at the University of Graz. After completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in History and Classics (Latin & Greek) in Graz (including an Erasmus stay in Montpellier), I transitioned into the field of Digital Humanities, and have been working on projects in this field since 2016. My PhD research, at the intersection of Digital Humanities and the early modern history of science, introduced computational methods into the history of alchemy. It focused on decoding cryptographical stylistic devices specific to alchemy (Decknamen) by drawing on the case study of chymist Michael Maier’s (1568-1622) Neo-Latin corpus. I was funded by a University of Graz bursary during my PhD (2018-2021) and I won the Bader Prize for the History of Science (Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2021) for my PhD thesis. 

In 2023, I was elected into the [board of directors of the German Digital Humanities Association (DHd)](https://dig-hum.de/dhd-vorstand), in which I also co-lead the [Empowerment working group](https://empowerdh.github.io/). I am also an observer in the council and web content editor of the {Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry (SHAC)](https://ambix.org/). I have been a fellow at several prestigious institutions in the U.S., Germany, and Austria. 

I was involved in [decrypting an alchemical cipher](https://theconversation.com/deciphering-the-philosophers-stone-how-we-cracked-a-400-year-old-alchemical-cipher-167900) which has underscored the latent potentials within the history of cryptography linked to alchemy. My interdisciplinary publications range across the history of science, alchemy and chymistry, historical cryptography, and the Digital and Computational Humanities, demonstrating a long-standing commitment to pushing the boundaries between computational methods of the Digital Humanities and the historiography of alchemy. 

I was PI in two projects, creating the video self-learning classes [Digitizing the Materiality of the Pre-Modern Book](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWNohMNguM_ndstozDRk7WcqjXv5EFzNC) & [Computer Vision for Digital Humanists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWNohMNguM_nO3SG9UrzPpbybV_UoCg5w) and have previously worked as a Digital Humanities research assistant in the [GRaF (Graz Repository of Ancient Fables](https://gams.uni-graz.atgraf) (2017-2019) and [Spectators](https://gams.uni-graz.at/mws) (2016-2017) projects.

I am the author of the blog [LaTeX Ninja'ing and the Digital Humanities](https://latex-ninja.com/).
